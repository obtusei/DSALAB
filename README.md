# DATA STRUCTURE AND ALOGRITHM LAB SHEET

## Arrays

1. **[Q1]** →  Write a program using user defined functions to find sum of 2- dimensional arrays ***(m\*n Matrix)***
   and store the sum of corresponding elements into third array and make a print function to print
   values of the matrix at the corresponding places (Not in a single row), get the transpose of the
   third matrix and call print function to display all 4matrices.

2. **[Q2]** → Write a program to multiply two ***(m ✕ n)*** matrices using dynamic memory allocation. Hints: 2
   matrices are multipliable only if the columns of first matrix are equal to rows of second matrix.
   The resultant matrix will be of the size r1 *c2. Use three nested for loops and use the following
   expression to calculate the element of third matrix: <br>
    `C[i][j]+=a[i][k]*b[k][j]`

## ADT

1. **[Q1]** → Create a ADT point and using that data type find the distance between two points.

## Stack

1. **[Q1]** → Write a menu driven program to illustrate basic operation of stack using array:
   1. Push
   2. Pop
   3. Top
   4. Display all
2. **[Q2]** → Write a program to evaluate a postfix expression.
3. **[Q3]** → Write a program to convert Infix Expression into Postfix Expression.

## Queue

1. **[Q1]** → Write a menu driven program to illustrate basic operations of linear Queue:
   1. Enqueue
   2. Dequeue
   3. Display all values
2. **[Q2]** → Write a menu driven program to illustrate basic operations of Circular queue:
   1. Using counter
   2. With one position vacant

## Linked List

1. **[Q1]** → Write a program using an Array to perform the following tasks for contiguous list: (Use Switch
   case for menu)
   1. **Insert**: *Insert a value at the end / at any specified position.*
   2. **Delete**: *Delete a value from the specified position*
   3. **Traverse**:*Print all the elements from O to last position*
   4. **Searching**:*Searching a particular value in the array*
